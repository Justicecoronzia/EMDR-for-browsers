## How to use
The way this form of therapy is supposed to work is by concentrating on a painful memory while looking at the square. With your arms across your torso in a manner where you are able to tap your opposite shoulder, you tap each shoulder corresponding to the beeps.

### The effect
The effect on PTSD when done right can be substantiel. Ten minutes doing this, with a couple of pauses and I was free of associating some good music to a relationship I had with a satan like entity.

I would love to hear some thoughts on its effectiveness.
